    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering has some issues that we have to pay attention, being the `computational cost and time` the first one. As seen on User-Based approach with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm, a laptop with 12GB of RAM memory got 100% usage of this hardware, even though the dataset's sample being small compared to the total amount of data: only fifteen thousand out of up to twenty-three million. A way to minimize the memory cost and increase the sample size was to use the Item-Based Approach with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Algorithm, but again, even getting better recommendations, we stumbled upon with the computation time problem. A sample size of two hundred fifty thousand observations took a considerable time to process compared to the other models made so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is the `available data`. Since our dataset is large and contains observations from a bunch of users and animes, we did not face it off, but it is important to have this issue in mind. Collaborative-Filtering requires a good number of users ratings of each anime in order to better recognizing the users tastes and retrieving more suitable recommendations. Due to this, when the platform has new users or new released animes, the Collaborative Filtering may not work very well with them, since the available data about them is scarce.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution for the first problem is literally using a more powerful machine too do the tasks, changing the KNN Algorithm for more performatic ones and/or working with better Hyperparameters Values.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the second problem, we can go into `Hybrid Filtering`, the best and last Recommendation System Technique we are going to see in this project."

    "`Hybrid Filtering` combines the Content-Based Filtering and the Collaborative Filtering altogether. It normally applies the first technique when there are few users ratings available foor a given anime and smoothly replaces it to the second technique as more users ratings become avaible for the given anime.\n",
    "\n",
    "To making things clearer, picture a situation where only a few users have rated Dragon Ball Z, in light of the small number of ratings, the technique will use Content-Based Filtering and recommend similar animes to Dragon Ball Z.\n",

    "In the other hand, a situation where many users have rated Noragami anime, due to the large number of ratings, the technique will use Collaborative Filtering and recommend similar items that similar users have liked.\n",

    "In a few words, `LightFM` is an Algorithm that implements Hybrid Filtering very well, making possible to incorporate both item and user data into Matrix Factorization Algorithms.

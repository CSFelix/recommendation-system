    "\n",
    "In the previous two notebooks, we dived into Content-Based Filtering with Plot Description and Metadatas approach and got better recommendations results!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, you may be wondering: *\"Okay, where is the catch? Is this method really perfect? Are there any problems with it?\"*. And yes, even though giving better results, there are some cons on Content-Based Filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem is that the recommendations are based on similiar items regardless the user tastes. Picture this, if user A and user B are into Mob Psycho 100, they both will receive the same similar animes recommendations, regardless their animes tastes and, consequently, a Recommendation Bubble is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, people tastes change over the time, so, even though user A are into shounen animes like Mob Psycho 100 today, in a few weeks this very user can be into slice-of-life animes and, since the given recommendations will be using Mob Psycho 100 as a parameter, the user will not receive any slice-of-life animes recommendations, leading to the user search for another platform to watch what he is looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in order to minimize these problems, a new recommendation method has been made up: `Collaborative Filtering`!! Let's find out what it is and how it works."

    "\n",
    "`Collaborative Filtering` reccomends animes that similar users liked, being able to get closer to the real users tastes. If you use Netflix, you probably already stumbled upon to some series marked as `For you`. If that's so, congrats, that is a real-world Collaborative Filtering Recommendation!! To make things even clearer, assume that two similar users, user A and user B, like Demon Slayer, and user B is also into Grand Blue, so the platform will recommend Grand Blue to user A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, this Filtering has two modes: 1) `User-Based`, where the user receives recommendations from items that similar users liked; and 2) `Item-Based`, where the user receives recommendations from items that similar users liked and the current user may well rate the recommended item.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "About the advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Better Recommendations** - `since it recommends animes that similar users liked, this system method tends to get closer to the user tastes when compared to Content-Based and Demographic Filtering`;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Personalized Recommendations** - `even though two users are searching for recommendations using the same anime, for instance Mob Psycho 100, both of them will receive different recommendations due to their tastes`;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Low Bubble of Recommendations** - `consequently, the probability of a Bubble of Recommendations be created is low and, even if one is created, it will be small`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages-wise:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **More Data Required** - `ir order to get closer to users tastes, in addition to having animes data, it is needed to have users data, such as their ratings on previously watched animes`;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Bubble of Recommendations** - `even though the probability of a small Bubble of Recommendations be created is low, there is yet the risk of it be happening`;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Outliers** - `it is needed to add a cut-off of users ratings and mean rating score by user in order to avoid outliers in the recommendations. For instance, consider that user A rated 100 animes with 1 score and the very user mean score of all rated animes is 1.5, it means that the user bad rated all animes he watched and, consequently, may be up no good in the platform giving outliers to the ratings`;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **More Computational Cost and Power** - `Collaborative-Filtering Algorithms are more complex and sofisticated to the previously ones, then, more computational cost and power is needed to run them`.\n",

Since the similarity is being calculated to user E, user E has full similarity to itself; also, user D is totally different to user E due to the similarity be -1.

    "Recommendation Systems are present everyday in our lives helping us to find the perfect anime to watch on Crunchyroll, or to binge watch that show on Netflix, keep watching related YouTube videos or even to buy new products on Amazon. I can spend the whole day listing examples about this system, but I think that you got the glimpse where Recommendation Systems are used, don't you?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, have you ever get bored on Netflix and Instagram because they only recommend items related to the same topic? It is not because I liked two videos about cars on Instagram that I am a huge fan of cars and want to see only reels and posts about it. Or it is not because I saw a gamer chair price on Amazon that I want to buy only gamer chairs. When you keep receiving recommendations only related to a especific topic or product, we say that you are into a Limited Bubble of Recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Bubble of Recomendations tends to make companies lose customers, so, in order to minimize these bubbles and to expand the recommendations' diversity, algorithms have been tuned and new variables have been considered to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, there are four main Recommendation Algorithms: `Demographic Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering and Hybrid Filtering`. We are going to dive into the first one in this notebook taking the animes dataset into context!!"

    "`Demographic Filtering` recommends animes that are popular between the users, that is, the animes with higher Bayesian or Arithmetic Mean Score and Popularity Rank. If you use Netflix, you probably already stumbled upon to some series marked as `Hot` or `Everyone is watching`. If that's so, congrats, that is a real-world Demographic Filtering Recommendation!! To make things even clearer, assume that Bleach, Oregairu and Jujutsu Kaisen are the animes with higher scores on a stream platform and it uses Demographic Filtering to recommend the animes. Guess what? The platform will recommend these very animes to all users!!\n",
    "\n",
    "About the advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Less Data Required** - `since it uses the Mean Score for recommendation, only animes data is required, ignoring the users data`;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Less Computational Time and Cost** - `consequently, the model training takes less time and cost to compute`;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Simple Evaluation Metrics** - `the metrics used for evaluation (Bayesian Mean Score, Arithmetic Mean Score and Popularity Rank) are not complicated to understand and to apply`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages-wise:\n",

    "\n",
    "`Arithmetic Mean` is the most known way to calculate means and you probably studied about it on school during your Basic Statistics classes. In few words, the metric works adding all elements and dividing by the number of elements, the result corresponds to the mean value. If you are a math person, the equation below may ring a bell:\n",

    "\n",
    "- x: element value;\n",
    "- n: total number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Even thoug we have a tendency to apply the metric for most scenarios, Arithmetic Mean can be a problem for Recommendation System Models due to the difference between the scoree value and the amount of scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, picture an anime that has an Arithmetic Mean Score of 9.8 and only 100 votes, and another anime with a Mean Score of 8.5 and 100,000 votes. Which one is better? The one with the higher score and less votes or the one with the smaller score and more votes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case and statistically speaking, it is correct to assume that the one with the smaller score and more votes is the better because the amount of votes for the first anime is too few that its Mean is not significantly considerable. There is a possibility that a bunch a users that will not like the anime did not watch and rated it already.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have just stumbled a problem: `there are situations the Arithmetic Mean is not suitable and can compromise Recommendation Systems Models`. We will discuss how to get around this problem later, for now, let's see what animes would be recommended by a Demographic Filtering Algorithm using Arithmetic Mean as metric."

    "Having this in mind, we can use the `Cumulative Mean`. Its idea is similar to the Arithmetic one, but the difference is that the value is not divided by the number of votes. So, if an anime got two ratings of 10, we say that its Cumulative Mean is 20, while its Arithmetic Mean is 10. But, this method has a problem too: consider an anime with 1,000,000 ratings of 1 score and another anime with 10,000 ratings of 10 score, if we calculate their Cumulative Mean, the first anime will have a score of 1,000,000 whereas the second one will have a score of 100,000. So, even though having the better ratings, the anime can be in a bad rank position if the number of votes is substancial lower than an anime with worse ratings and a huge number of votes.\n",

    "In order to solve these two problems and to giver better, realistic mean scores, the `Bayesian Mean` has been created!! Its idea is simple, first we have to find the number of ratings of the item, the Arithmetic Mean of the item, the minimum number of ratings that an item must have to be considered in the system and the Arithmetic Mean across all items. After that, we apply them in the following equation:\n",
